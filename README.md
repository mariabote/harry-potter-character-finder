Find your favorite character from the Harry Potter saga.
In this project I have used an Api to access the data of the Harry Potter characters. You can find a home website where you can search by name or using a filter for each house.
Each character has a card to know their details in detail: status, species, gender and house.
In addition, the website has a button called Lumos that makes the website change from dark mode to its opposite.
For this web application I have used:
Html
sass
flexbox,
CSS Grid
Javascript
React
